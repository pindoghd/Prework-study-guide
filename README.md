# Prework-study-guide

## Description

 We created a foundation for the webpage using basic HTML functions 

 We then added a cascading style sheet to make the website more presentable

 Finally we finished by adding JavaScript to the project.


## Installation

We first made a Git hub repository for the webpage to share files to our local device.#

We then used VS code too add the coding to our webpage and kept our github repository up to daye by performing push and pull requests from our git bash console

## Usage

the study guide can be used by referencing notes that we added during the build process of the webpage.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
